# StockHardware

StockHardware is a _personal project_ that I use to learn **MERN stack** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and Node.js). The concept is bare simple : an e-commerce website that sells GPUs and CPUs.

Note : this project is a **work-in-progress**.

- Admins can do the same as members and are able to :
